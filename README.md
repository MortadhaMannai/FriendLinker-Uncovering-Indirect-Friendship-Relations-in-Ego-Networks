## Project Description ##
Project mainly results in finding indirect composite relations for a particular node in an ego network.
This particular project mainly focuses on **Friend** relation and finds and indirect friendship relation between several egos in an ego network.

## Result ##
Upon the action of the algorithm on the dataset the user will be able to find friend connections up-to a limit (L)

For instance,

**if L = 1   |=  Result => Direct Friends (1st Connection)**

**if L = 2   |=  Result => Friend of Friends (2nd Connection)**
  
**if L = 3   |=  Result => Friend of Friend of Friends (3rd Connection)**   **and so on......**



## TODOs ##

- [x] Understand the basic framework of the dataset
- [x] Implement Algorithm on the dataset
- [x] Publish applicable results in the form of graphs with appropriate parameters
- [x] Development of a proper UI showing traversal of each node with the progress of the algorithm
